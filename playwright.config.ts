 * Two lanes, split by whether a test needs the 23 MB model.
 *
 * The fast lane is everything the page does before any model exists: presets, controls and
 * first paint. It runs in seconds on every push.
 *
 * The model lane is tagged @model and downloads the real thing. It is slow, but it is the
 * only lane that can catch a broken backend: the WebGPU load path failed for weeks while
 * every unit test stayed green, because nothing ever asked a browser to run it.
